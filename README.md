Welcome to the ColorGame
The object of this game is to guess a color based on the RBG color spectrum. As you know colors in code range from 0-255. "0" being the least and "255" being the most saturation of the colors. Based on this spectrum, you have to guess what color is being displayed in front of you. When you guess incorrectly the color that you guessed fades away, when you guess correctly the whole page changes and becomes that color. Give it a shot


Warning: if you're looking to copy the code, the "node_modules" folder may be missing due to it's large size..
